The main purpose of this Solidity smart contract is to create and manage non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the 
Ethereum blockchain. The contract consists of two primary contracts: MyNFT and NFTFactory.

MyNFT Contract:
This contract represents the NFT itself and inherits from the ERC721 standard, which is a widely used standard 
for creating NFTs.
The contract allows for the creation of NFTs with a specified name and symbol.
It provides functionality for minting NFTs, which means creating unique tokens and assigning ownership to 
Ethereum addresses.
NFT owners can set the metadata (e.g., token URI) associated with their tokens.
The contract keeps track of the total number of tokens minted with tokenIdCounter.
The creator of the contract is able to mint new tokens.

NFTFactory Contract:
This contract serves as a factory for creating instances of the MyNFT contract.
It is responsible for deploying new instances of the MyNFT contract with customizable names and symbols.
When a new NFT contract is created, the factory contract mints an initial NFT and assigns ownership to the creator.

The main purpose of these contracts is to enable users to create and manage their own NFT collections 
on the Ethereum blockchain. The MyNFT contract defines the behavior of individual NFTs, while the NFTFactory 
contract provides a streamlined way for users to create their NFT contracts with custom names and symbols. This 
system is commonly used in decentralized applications (DApps) and marketplaces for tokenizing and trading 
unique digital assets, such as digital art, collectibles, and more.
