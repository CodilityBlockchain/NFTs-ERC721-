The main purpose of this Solidity smart contract, named "NFTMarketplace," is to provide a platform for users 
to buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and conduct auctions for these digital assets. Here are the key 
functionalities and purposes of this contract:

NFT Listing for Sale: Users can list their NFTs for sale on the marketplace. This involves specifying the NFT's 
contract address, token ID, and the price at which they want to sell it.

NFT Purchase: Other users can purchase NFTs that are listed for sale by sending the specified price in Ether. 
When a purchase is made, the NFT is transferred from the seller to the buyer, and the payment is distributed to 
the seller and the marketplace owner.

NFT Unlisting: If a seller decides to remove their NFT from the marketplace before it's sold, they can unlist 
it. The NFT is then returned to the seller, and the listing is deactivated.

Auction Listing: Users can also list their NFTs for auction. This involves specifying the NFT's contract address, 
token ID, a reserve price, and an auction end time. Other users can place bids on the NFTs during the auction 
period.

Bid Placement: Users can place bids on NFTs listed for auction. Bids must be higher than the current highest 
bid. The highest bidder at the end of the auction wins the NFT.

Auction Completion: When an auction ends (based on the specified end time), the highest bidder receives the NFT, 
and the auction's proceeds are transferred to the seller. The NFT is also transferred back to the seller if the 
reserve price is not met.

Marketplace Fees: The marketplace charges a fee (marketFees) for each transaction, which is deducted from the 
sale or auction proceeds and transferred to the marketplace owner.

Withdrawal: Both sellers of NFTs and the marketplace owner can withdraw their assets from the contract. Sellers 
can withdraw their unsold NFTs, and the marketplace owner can withdraw their accumulated fees and any unsold 
auction NFTs.

Ownership Tracking: The contract keeps track of NFT ownership, active listings, auction details, and the 
highest bidders for each auction.

In summary, this smart contract serves as a decentralized NFT marketplace and auction platform, allowing users 
to list NFTs for sale, participate in auctions, and conduct transactions with automated fee handling. It 
provides a transparent and secure way to trade NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.
